The purpose of the "Multi-Party Conference Chat" project is to develop a robust and secure communication system that enables real-time collaboration among multiple users. This project aims to establish a seamless client-server connection, implement user registration and authentication processes, maintain active client sessions with automatic reconnection capabilities, and support concurrent server handling to manage multiple chat requests efficiently. Additionally, the system ensures effective message broadcasting to all connected users while maintaining a list of registered users and terminating sessions upon disconnection.
